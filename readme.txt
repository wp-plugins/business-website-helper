A helper to quickly get your business website up and running on any WordPress install with the best in class plugins.

== Description ==

For small businesses self-hosting WordPress there’s no easy way to find the best plugins to install.

From working exclusively with businesses over the years and reviewing hundreds of plugins, we put together a list of the best ones available in this plugin.  This plugin shows you the best options based on price, power, and simplicity.  It’ll also tell you whether or not they’re installed and active on your website.

This plugin makes recommendations for the following areas:


* Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
* Content Delivery Network (CDN)
* Website Optimization (Caching)
* Analytics & Website Statistics
* Email Address Protection
* Distributed Libraries
* Spelling & Grammar
* Spam Prevention
